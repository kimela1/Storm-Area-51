# Storm-Area51
A one-player, text-based adventure game where the player can move through spaces to obtain items and accomplish tasks.

**Rules:** The goal is to befriend an alien hidden in Area 51. There are special actions and items in this map that will help and hurt you. If you take too long, you will lose too much health and the alien will abduct you. Be careful!
